# Introduction to Python and Web Scraping Workshop

Welcome, hackers!

This workshop serves as an introduction to the fundamentals of the Python programming language as well as an overview of basic web scraping tasks. We will cover some simple web scraping tasks specifically centered around a political science case study (that might come in handy for your hackathon project!).

For set-up instructions, please refer to the PDF document `Instructions.pdf`
